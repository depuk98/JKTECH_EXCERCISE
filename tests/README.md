# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the FastAPI User Management System with Document Processing and Vector Search.

## Types of Tests

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, mocking all dependencies.

**Examples:**
- Tests for document service methods
- Tests for user service methods
- Tests for data models and schemas

These tests ensure that each function works as expected with controlled inputs and outputs.

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together correctly by testing interactions between two or more units.

**Examples:**
- Testing document service with database operations
- Testing vector search with pgvector functionality

These tests ensure that components integrate properly with each other.

### 3. API Tests

API tests verify the HTTP endpoints behavior by making requests and checking responses.

**Examples:**
- Testing document upload endpoint
- Testing document search endpoint
- Testing authentication endpoints

These tests ensure that the API behaves as expected from a client perspective.

### 4. Functional Tests

Functional tests verify entire features from a user perspective, often simulating real user workflows.

**Examples:**
- Document upload, processing, and search workflow
- User registration, login, and profile management workflow

### 5. Performance Tests

Performance tests measure the system's performance metrics under various conditions.

**Examples:**
- Search response time under load
- Document processing throughput

## Key Test Areas

### Document Management

- **Document Upload**: Tests document file upload, validation, and initial record creation
- **Document Processing**: Tests document extraction, chunking, and embedding generation
- **Document Deletion**: Tests document and related chunks deletion with proper permissions

### Vector Search

- **pgvector Integration**: Tests the integration with PostgreSQL vector extension
- **Search Functionality**: Tests semantic search, keyword fallback, and ranking of results
- **Query Processing**: Tests embedding generation for search queries

### User Management

- **Authentication**: Tests login, token generation, and verification
- **Authorization**: Tests permission checks for various operations
- **User CRUD**: Tests user creation, updating, and deletion

## Test Architecture

### Fixtures

We use pytest fixtures to provide common test dependencies:

- `db`: Database session for testing
- `client`: FastAPI test client
- `mock_document`, `mock_user`: Mock objects for testing
- `user_token_headers`, `superuser_token_headers`: Authentication headers

### Mocking Strategy

For unit and integration tests, we mock external dependencies:

- Database operations
- File I/O operations
- Embedding model calls
- Asynchronous tasks

### Testing Database

Tests use SQLite in-memory database instead of PostgreSQL for faster execution and isolation.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run specific test categories:

```bash
# Run API tests
pytest tests/test_api/

# Run service tests
pytest tests/test_services/

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not affect other tests
2. **Mocking**: Use appropriate mocking to isolate the unit under test
3. **Assertions**: Make specific assertions about expected outcomes
4. **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
5. **Performance**: Keep tests fast to allow frequent execution during development
